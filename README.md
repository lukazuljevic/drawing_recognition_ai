# Drawing Recognition AI

A machine learning web application. Users can draw directly in the browser, and the system attempts to recognize the drawing in real-time using a trained neural network.

## Overview

This project combines a **React + TypeScript** frontend with a **TensorFlow + Keras** AI model trained on the **Quick Draw dataset**. It demonstrates real-time AI inference, containerization, and continuous deployment.

### ✨ Features

- 🧠 Drawing recognition with a custom-trained model (25 drawing categories)
- 🖍️ Interactive canvas-based drawing UI (React + TypeScript)
- 📦 Containerized with Docker
- ☁️ Deployed on AWS EC2
- 🔁 CI/CD with CircleCI
- 🔧 (Planned) Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform
- 🔧 (Planned) Ansible implementation
